The Original Dataset is subdivided in two subdatasets:
- Training set
- Test set
Sometimes the Training set is subdivided into
- Training set
- Validation set

Training set and Validation set is used to train the model and evaluate in the training stage how it performs
The Test set is the set used in the Final performance estimate test
#### Overfitting
create a model that matches the training data so closely that the model fails to make correct predictions on new data
Addressing overfitting:
- Reducing number of features manually or with amodel selection algorithm like PCA
- Regularization keeping

##### Regularization: Ridge regression

#### Underfitting
creating a model with poor predictive ability because the model hasn't fully captured the complexity of the training data
