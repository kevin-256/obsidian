Machine Learning is the ability to make a computer learn without being explicitly programmed

Machine Learning Algorithms:
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unsupervised Learning
 - Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning
A popular learning technique for training neural networks on labeled data for a specific task. You can think of supervised learning as a classroom where a student is taught by a teacher with many examples.

#### Classification
A classification algorithm can generate a decision boundary that separate those positive and negative examples we gave earlier. So if we give new data, the algorithm can decide of which of the class the new data is part of.
This algorithm is trained by some data and a label that classify this data into one of the two classes. (Example is a mail spam)
#### Regression
A regression algorithm can generate a value, a float, based on the input data.
This algorithm is trained by giving some data as input and it returns a float as output. (Example house price prediction based on size)

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a deep learning technique used to find implicit patterns in the data without being explicitly trained on labeled data.(Example subdividing google news based on similarity)

#### Self Supervised Learning
Self-supervised learning is a machine learning process where the model trains itself to learn one part of the input from another part of the input. It is also known as predictive or pretext learning.
In this process, the unsupervised problem is transformed into a supervised problem by auto-generating the labels.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a method used to train AI agents to learn environment behavior in specific contexts using reward feedback policy.
