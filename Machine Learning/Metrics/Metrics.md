Confusion matrix
![](Images/ConfusionMatrix.png)

First there is True/False, if we have given or not the correct output
Then there is Positive/Negative, this is what we have predicted
True Positive -> Prediction true and it's right
True Negative -> Prediction false and it's right
False Positive -> Prediction true and it's wrong
False Negative -> Prediction false and it's wrong


**Accuracy** is Correct Predictions over all predictions:
(TP+TN)/(FP+FN+TP+TN)

**Prediction** is
